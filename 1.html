  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://sunykorea.ac.kr/" title="SUNY Korea homepage">SUNY Korea</a> wants to create an inclusive educational environment
  that is accessible and equitable for all students.
  One way to do this is to provide Academic Accommodation Services
  to all SUNY Korea students with disabilities.
  If you have a physical or mental disability and need Accommodations,
  please see the following documents.
  Please note that the process for setting up Accommodations can
  take 2-4 weeks and should be completed before the beginning of the semester.
